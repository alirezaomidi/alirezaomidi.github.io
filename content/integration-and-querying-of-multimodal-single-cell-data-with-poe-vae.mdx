## Abstract

Constructing joint representations from multimodal single-cell datasets is crucial for understanding cellular heterogeneity and function. Traditional methods, such as factor analysis and kNN-based approaches, face computational limitations with scalability across large datasets and multiple modalities. In this work, we demonstrate the product-of-experts VAE-based model, which offers a flexible, scalable solution for integrating multimodal data, allowing for the seamless mapping of both unimodal and multimodal queries onto a reference atlas.

We evaluate how different strategies for combining modalities in the VAE framework impact query-to-reference mapping across diverse datasets, including CITE-seq and spatial metabolomics. Our benchmarks assess batch effect correction, biological signal preservation, and imputation of missing modalities. We showcase our approach in a mosaic setting, integrating CITE-seq and multiome data to accurately map unimodal and multimodal queries into the joint latent space.
