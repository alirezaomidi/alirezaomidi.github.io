## Abstract

Multimodal analysis of single-cell samples from healthy and diseased tissues at various stages provides a comprehensive view that identifies disease-specific cells, their molecular features and aids in patient stratification. Here, we present MultiMIL, a novel weakly-supervised multimodal model designed to construct multimodal single-cell references and prioritize phenotype-specific cells via patient classification. MultiMIL effectively integrates single-cell modalities, even when they only partially overlap, providing robust representations for downstream analyses such as phenotypic prediction and cell prioritization.
